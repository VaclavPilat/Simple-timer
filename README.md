# Simple timer
Simple console timer to keep track of total time spent.

## How it works
The program works with timestamps created by user - when you want the timer to begin, make a START timestamp and a STOP timestamp to end the current term.

You can use multiple time calculation methods (simple between timestamps, daily, weekly, monthly and annual calculations).

## How to run
1. Make sure you have installed Python 3. You don't have to install any other packages.
2. Locate and run file `Main.py`.

You can add commands as arguments for them to be run all at once:
```
./Main.py days months today
```
